> Kimberley is one of the key forces addressing the UK tech industry diversity gap. As one of the main organisers of codebar, she facilitates free weekly coding workshops for under-represented groups. She also organises one-off events, including beginner friendly hack days and workshops dedicated to first-time Open Source contributions. When not doing all this, she works at Shortlist Media reinventing the online presence of their magazines Stylist and Shortlist.
